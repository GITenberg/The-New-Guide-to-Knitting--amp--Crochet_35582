KNITTING AND CROCHET</h2>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="SIBERIAN_CUFFS" id="SIBERIAN_CUFFS"></a>SIBERIAN CUFFS.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Nine</span> shades of wool used double, or double Berlin, either in shades of
sable or chinchilli, look best. Cast on sixty stitches, knit three plain
rows with the darkest shade; in the fourth row seam two stitches
together; pass the wool round, seam two together; pass the wool round,
seam two together, and so on till the end of the row. Join on the next
shade, and knit three plain rows. In the fourth row, seam two together;
pass the wool round, and seam two together the same as before; continue
in this manner knitting three plain rows and an open row of each shade,
until the ninth of white. Only knit two plain rows; this will reverse
the shades: join the second lightest shade, and knit one plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> row and
one open row; two plain rows; continue knitting one plain row, one open
row, and two plain rows of each shade; it will then correspond in
appearance with the other side; then sew the two edges together, and let
the join come in the centre of the wrong side, and it will look as
though knit double.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="LEAF_PATTERN" id="LEAF_PATTERN"></a>LEAF PATTERN FOR A PINCUSHION.</h3>

<p>Cast on each needle forty-five stitches, fifteen for each pattern.
<i>First round</i>&mdash;pass the thread in front, purl two, knit one, taking the
back part of the loop; purl two, slip one, knit one, and bring the
slipped stitch over the last knit, knit six, bring the thread forward;
knit one; continue this till the round is completed. <i>Second
round</i>&mdash;thread before, purl two, knit one, taking the back part of the
loop; purl two, slip one, and cast the slipped over; knit the remaining
stitches plain; in the first row you have increased one stitch in every
fifteen; the second brings them to the original number; knit these
rounds alternately, making the holes (which occur in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> alternate
row) one stitch sooner each time, <i>i. e.</i>, knitting five, then four,
then three, then two, then one, instead of six stitches, and plain to
the purled stitches, then commence as before.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="TWISTED_KNITTING" id="TWISTED_KNITTING"></a>TWISTED KNITTING.</h3>

<p>Begin with about twenty stitches on one needle, and with the other knit
two or three plain rows; next row knit six plain, purl eight, knit the
remainder plain; knit the next row plain, and so on for twelve rows;
next row, when the right side is towards you, after knitting the first
six stitches plain, take a third needle, and slip off four stitches, and
keep them behind till you have knit the next four; then knit them; this
forms the twist; then knit the remaining six plain; knit the next row
plain, and so on for twelve rows; then repeat the twist.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="VANDYKE_BORDER" id="VANDYKE_BORDER"></a>VANDYKE BORDER.</h3>

<p>Cast on nine stitches, slip one, knit one, bring the thread forward, and
knit two together for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> three times, thread forward, knit one, purl the
next row; repeat these two rows alternately, increasing one plain stitch
each time in the fancy row, until you have eighteen stitches; to
decrease the point, slip the first, knit two together, bring the thread
forward, and knit two together for four times, until it is reduced to
nine stitches; every alternate row is purled.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="OPEN_KNITTED_LACE_CUFFS" id="OPEN_KNITTED_LACE_CUFFS"></a>OPEN KNITTED LACE CUFFS.</h3>

<p>Needles No. 20, and No. 34, Boar’s-head cotton. Cast on thirty-four
stitches, knit four plain rows. <i>Fifth row</i>&mdash;knit two, slip one, knit
one, pass the slipt one over the knitted one, bring the thread forward,
knit one, thread forward, knit one, thread forward, purl one, and so on
to the end of the row. Commence the next row by slipping one, and
continue as before, till you come to the end of the row, where you will
have two plain stitches left, which are to be knit; continue with these
rows alternately, <a name="corr3" id="corr3"></a>until the cuff is long enough for the wrist, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
cast off the stitches, and edge it with narrow Valenciennes lace, or
with the Vandyke edging.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="PRUDENCE_CAP" id="PRUDENCE_CAP"></a>PRUDENCE CAP.</h3>

<p>Cast on fifty stitches coloured wool, knit eight rows, knitting and
purling alternate rows, and twisting each stitch; five rows of coloured,
and four of white wool, knit loosely on small ivory pins, for the edge.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="CARDINAL_CAPE" id="CARDINAL_CAPE"></a>CARDINAL CAPE.</h3>

<p>Cast on seventy-two stitches in the Brioche stitch, which is done by
bringing the wool forward; slip one stitch off underneath, and knit two
together, coloured wool, and knit one row, besides the casting-on row,
white wool, knit four times from end to end; and then leave six stitches
each time, till you have formed one gore; twice and back with coloured
wool; and then another white gore; fourteen white gores,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> and finish
with one coloured <a name="corr4" id="corr4"></a>row; and then cast off. Border for the lower end, with
an open scollop: run one string round the row of holes, and another
string in a few stitches lower to form the waist; the Brioches are done
in the same manner; but twelve gores, and each different colours; you
cast on sixty stitches instead of seventy-two: six oz. white, and two
coloured four-thread fleecy, or double Berlin wool, is enough for cape

border, half a pound of white for the middle, and one pound of common
for the back; also two skeins of black for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> tails; it must all be in
six-thread fleecy, except the common for the back, which requires
twelve-thread. No. 6 pin, by the eagle gauge, is required. Cast on
seventy-two stitches with the common white, knit one plain row, then
take a skein of the darkest or lightest, according to fancy, cut the
skein into half, and divide each half into four, so that the pieces may
be about half a quarter in length; slip the first stitch; then take two
of the pieces of wool, put them on the left hand pin, twisting it so
that one may be behind and the other in front; knit the next stitch, and
the two pieces of wool altogether; bring the ends in front and knit
another stitch, one plain row between each, and three rows of each four
shades; cut previous to commencing the second shade put in two pieces of
the darkest at each end; this for three rows: the third shade, two
pieces of each of the previous shades, and so on, until you have
completed the border, by knitting in the four shades; then put in two
pieces of each colour, and commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> the white; you will have
forty-eight stitches for the white; knit twelve rows, that is to say,
six rows putting the pieces in, and every other one being plain, makes
the twelve rows; then knit in six pieces, take two of the black, and
then twelve more white, one piece of black and twelve more white, one
more of black; if the mat is larger or smaller, the centre stitches have
only to be equally divided by spots of black: the next row you must put
in two black over the one in the previous row, and in the third row one
of black over each two; then six more rows of white, that is twelve with
the plain one, and then knit in twelve pieces before you commence the
black; repeat this as above-mentioned; you will find that this time you
will have only space for two black spots; continue in this way till it
is finished: it is then combed out until it resembles fur; you then
twist the four pieces of black together to resemble the tail; a little
gum is then used in twisting this. After having been well combed, they

twenty-four rows, or twelve turns of white; then commence the scarlet,

knitting the first thirty on each side, without decreasing; then bring
the wool forward, slip one stitch, and knit five together; repeat this
till within thirty on the other side, which, knit without decreasing,
until you have only forty ribs, or one hundred and twenty stitches; knit
forty-eight rows, or twenty-four turns, in this manner, still leaving
the white on each side; put thirty stitches on another needle for the
front, knit those backwards and forwards for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> thirty-six rows, or
eighteen turns; then knit all the stitches but one rib, turn back, and

the proper length for the shoulder. Cast off, but be particular that the
slanting side is not in front; finish the other side in the same way,
then take up the stitches for the back; knit thirty-six rows, to
correspond with the fronts for the arm-hole; then knit backwards and
forwards, leaving one rib each way, until it is the same length as the
slanting part in front, which are to be joined together; cast off; now
take up the white stitches on each side, and knit till it is long enough
to go up the sides; for the sleeves; cast on seventy-two stitches, knit
thirty rows, then twelve more, leaving one rib on the one side to form
the wide part; for the collar; cast on seventy-six stitches, and knit

fleecy, but they look much better in double Berlin wool, No. 9 pins, by
the Eagle <a name="corr8" id="corr8"></a>gauge. For a lady’s, you must cast on stitches in proportion,

needle, draw it through all the stitches, and fasten it inside. Divide
your stitches for each finger, taking two more for each of the two first
fingers, than for the other two; it is better to measure by a glove, for
the length of the fingers and thumb: this pattern is for the left hand,
and wants the pattern for the back, reversing and knitting on the last,
instead of the first pin; two-thread fleecy is required.</p>

CLOSE AND OPEN CROCHET WORK.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> greater part of close crochet articles are done in the double-plain
stitch, which is done by taking a piece of wool, and casting on as many
loops in chain-stitch as you may require, with the needle; it is very
simple, being only to form a loop and draw the wool through one and
another; the easiest manner would be, to continue drawing the wool
through from right to left; this will make the work the same on both
sides. The plain single-crochet is done by merely drawing the one loop
you have on your needle through each stitch. Plain double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> crochet is
when you have cast on the foundation-loops, draw the wool through one
stitch; take it up again, and through two; this stitch is used for
table-covers and sofa-cushions; also when patterns are worked in. In the
double-stitch crochet, you take both sides of the loop, but that is only
used when you require it thick, and is very nice for soles for shoes.</p>

<p><a name="Raised_Crochet" id="Raised_Crochet"></a><span class="smcap">Raised Crochet</span> is worked alternately from one side to the other, drawing
the wool quite through, and taking the underneath part of the loop.</p>

<p><a name="Chain_open_Crochet" id="Chain_open_Crochet"></a>The <span class="smcap">Chain open Crochet</span> is made of chains, as for instance, five or seven
loops drawn one through the other, and joined to the centre stitch of
the preceding row; this is very pretty for purses, with a bead on each
of the centre stitches.</p>

<p><a name="Single_open_Crochet" id="Single_open_Crochet"></a><span class="smcap">Single open Crochet</span> is done by putting your needle under the wool, and
then through the loop, draw the wool through, you will find that you
have three stitches on your needle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> draw the wool through the first two
stitches, and then through the other two; you will now have one loop:
make one by drawing the wool through that one; put it underneath and
through the next loop but one; repeat as before.</p>

<p><a name="Double_open_Crochet" id="Double_open_Crochet"></a><span class="smcap">Double open Crochet</span> is done by drawing it through in the same manner as
you did for the single, but omitting the one-loop stitch until you have
done two long stitches between each of the long ones.</p>

<p><a name="Treble_open_Crochet" id="Treble_open_Crochet"></a><span class="smcap">Treble open Crochet</span> is much the same as the preceding patterns, but
having three long stitches and three loop stitches <a name="corr10" id="corr10"></a>between; in the next
row, remember to make the long stitches upon the loops, and the loops on
the preceding long <a name="corr11" id="corr11"></a>stitches; you increase by going twice in the same
loop, and decrease by missing one loop.</p>

<p><a name="Treble_Vandyke_open_Crochet" id="Treble_Vandyke_open_Crochet"></a>There is another stitch called the <span class="smcap">Treble Vandyke open Crochet</span>, which is

and the same to the darkest. You may do them in shaded wool, with white
between: make it about three complete stripes or half-a-yard square; you
can crochet both sides, or have silk at the back.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="A_CARPET_BAG" id="A_CARPET_BAG"></a>A CARPET BAG.</h3>

<p>This is done in the plain double crochet, also in plain double Berlin

border on each side&mdash;say a narrow border of green leaves, perhaps ten or
twelve stitches wide, on a scarlet ground, the centre a black ground,
with a diamond arabesque pattern, in bright golds, scarlets, greens, and
blues; to be about half-a-yard wide altogether, with the border on the
other side; you can vary the other part of the bag at pleasure. They are
made up with patent leather sides and bottom, with steel at the top. In
working patterns, be particular to pass the whole between the needle and
the wool you are working with.</p>

to the top of the other side, then commence four loops below, and work
till within four of the other side, and so on for eight rows, leaving
three less each time; twelve pieces are required done in this manner;
all different colours are prettier, or at least six, and repeat them
once when you have finished, then crochet them all together and six rows
completely round the bottom; you will find you have a space in the
middle; crochet enough rows to fill this up, decreasing every three
loops; make a round cushion, and cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> it with your crochet: put a
Brioche mount in the centre.</p>

<p>Commence by casting on three hundred loops, and crochet six plain rows
in black, then thread your beads on the blue, and crochet a piece, which
is done by making the wrong side of crochet the right; when you are
putting on the beads, you must put your needle through the loop, pass a
bead up close to the stitch, and finish it, and so on, until the piece
is completed; then twelve rows plain, in blue, and six black; the
seventh and eighth are done in the plain open crochet. To pass the cord
through, you ought to choose a pattern from forty to fifty rows deep.</p>

<p>You may also do round bags, commencing with three stitches, and
increasing one in every other, for the first six rounds, and one in
every three, for the next twelve, and so on until the bottom is large
enough; then as many rounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> as you require for the size of the bag;

<p>Cast on one hundred and forty loops, crochet one plain row, then one row
of plain open crochet in every loop, one row of the open Vandyke treble
crochet; the following of close crochet, if done correctly, will form a
leaf. <i>First</i>&mdash;work along stitch in every loop. <i>Second</i>&mdash;work three
long stitches into three loops, make four chain stitches, miss two loops
of the foundation, work a stitch of double plain crochet into the next,
make four chain stitches, miss two of the foundation, and repeat. <i>Third
row</i>&mdash;work three long stitches over the three in the last row, make five
chain stitches, work a stitch of double crochet over the one in the last
row, make five chain stitches, and repeat. <i>Fourth round</i>&mdash;the same as
the third. <i>Fifth row</i>&mdash;work five stitches of double crochet, beginning
on the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> chain stitches; before the three long stitches in last row,
make eight chain stitches, and repeat one row quite round of the single
open crochet; in every loop at the corners of the collar, you must
increase two stitches at each end row. To commence the border, or edge
of the collar, which of course is carried round as the preceding
row&mdash;<i>First row</i>&mdash;make a long stitch, make one chain stitch, work
another long stitch in the same loop, make three chain stitches, miss
two of the foundation, and repeat. <i>Second row</i>&mdash;work a long stitch into
the one chain stitch in last row, make one chain stitch, work another
long stitch into the same place, make two chain stitches, and repeat.
<i>Third row</i>&mdash;the same as the second. <i>Fourth row</i>&mdash;work a long stitch
into the one chain stitch of the last row, make six chain stitches, and
repeat: these collars may be worked in many other patterns, some of
which are to be found in a book called Crochet Collars. No. 14, or 16,
Boar’s-head cotton, and a small steel needle is required.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="A_PLAIN_PURSE" id="A_PLAIN_PURSE"></a>A PLAIN PURSE.</h3>

<p>Cast on seventy or eighty loops, and crochet six rows in double open
crochet; it is prettier in two colours, say French blue, and Ponceau,
seven stripes are wide enough; they look well with one end square, and a
fringe of beads at the bottom.</p>

<span class="size70per">IN TREBLE VANDYKE CROCHET.</span></h3>

<p>Choose any pretty shades, or shaded double Berlin, with rather a small
sized hook; cast on one hundred loops, and crochet if in shades, one row
of each colour, about thirty rows is required to make it wide enough;
they are joined so as to leave it open down the centre, and lined with
silk or satin; you will find them better with some scent in between the
lining: they are to be fastened with a pretty button, or ribbon.</p>

<p>Cast on for a gentleman, forty loops in double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> Berlin, and crochet
twenty rounds in shaded wool, then six rows of the chain open crochet;
ladies’ may be done in single wool.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="RAISED_CROCHET_SLIPPERS" id="RAISED_CROCHET_SLIPPERS"></a>RAISED CROCHET SLIPPERS.</h3>

<p>These are to be done in two colours, say shaded blue or scarlet, with
black stripes between; cast on twelve loops, crochet four rows in black,
increasing one stitch on each side, and one in the middle, this will
form a point on the top of the foot; then two rows of red wool,
increasing; you ought to have three stripes of black, and two of
coloured; leave all the stitches except twelve at the side, continue six
stripes of black, and seven of coloured: will make them large enough for
a lady; join the stripe to twelve stitches on the other side, sew these
to a cork sole, and bind them round the top with ribbon.</p>

commence with four stitches in the single open crochet; make four loops,

so on, in the next row; be particular to make the long stitches come
over the chain, and <i>vice versa</i>; one row of the double open crochet

pretty Vandyke edge, if in wool, one row of each shade.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="SHAWL" id="SHAWL"></a>SHAWL.</h3>

<p>These made with two coloured grounds in stripes, are very handsome; say
black and white, with a pattern of two colours, four shades of each,
perhaps lilacs and greens on the white ground, and French blue and
scarlet on the black, with a narrow stripe of gold colour, between each
stripe of the ground. Cast on five loops with black, and increase one
stitch at the commencement, one in the middle, and one at the end; then
break off your wool, and commence at the same side, this is at the
neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> and is to be done in the plain double crochet; continue in this
manner until the shawl is large enough, then loop on a fringe; these
must be done in double German wool, with the fringe in fleecy.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="WATCH_CHAINS2" id="WATCH_CHAINS2"></a>WATCH CHAINS.</h3>

<p>Cast on five loops, and crochet round until long enough; beads may be
introduced the same as on purses, which have a very pretty effect.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
